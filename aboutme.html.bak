          <h2>Music</h2>
          <p style="color: white;Font-family:lobster;">These songs are my
            favorite songs from my top two favorite music groups, Enhypen, which
            is Kpop, and &amp;Team which is Jpop. I have a lot more that I like
            but if I listed all of them it would be very tiring for me and
            boring for you.</p>

          <h2>My family</h2>
          <p style="color: white;Font-family:lobster;">My family is Indian and
            my brother and I were born in the U.S. but fun fact, I'm not
            originally from Massachusetts and neither is my brother. In fact
            we're both from different states.</p>
          <p style="color: white;Font-family:lobster;"> I was born in Minnesota
            on April 19, 2010 but we moved when I was a month old to New Jersey
            because my mom had gotten accepted into NYU. I lived in New Jersey
            for 3 years and that's where my brother was born. Soon after my mom
            started residency, my dad got a job as a software engineer at google
            in boston, so we moved to Massachusetts. We also move 3 times in
            Massachusetts.</p>
          <p style="color: white;Font-family:lobster;">the pictures shown below
            are a stir fry ramen and a strawberry shortcake that I made </p>

            &nbsp; These are only 2 of the things I know how to make.I also know
            how to make soups, ice cream, homemade pasta with homemade sauce,and
            a lot more. &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

            <p> And fun fact, I have an insanely high spice tolerance so
              sometimes the food I make can be inedible to some. Here is a video
              of me winning a spicy pepper contest against my english teacher. </p>

          <h2> School Life </h2>
          <p style="color: white;Font-family:lobster;"> As I said earlier I
            attend Algonquin Regional Highschool in Northborough and I'm a
            rising sophmore. Afterschool I'm part of the MSA, Neuroscience club,
            and I also do the robotics club although tbh I don't really do much
            in there. I also did something called Story Bridge which is kind of
            like a public speaking sort of thing. I'm not going to go too much
            in depth about it though because it's kind of hard to explain, but
            here is a video of my presentation. Just watch it when I'm not here.</p>
